### About Me

I'm currently working at **Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd.** where I focus on leveraging **shell scripts for automation**, specifically for monitoring and upgrading systems[cite: 3]. I have successfully deployed and configured numerous **WebMethods JVMs and IBM MQ servers** on Linux VMs for critical go-live projects[cite: 3]. My role also involves developing WebMethods code for administrative purposes [cite: 4] and creating Excel dashboards for large-scale data representation[cite: 5]. I'm also skilled in developing automation for regular tasks like SSL Certificate renewal and JVM upgrades[cite: 6].

I hold a **Master of Business Administration with a specialization in Data Science** from Manipal Academy of Higher Education and a **Bachelor of Science in Maths** (with minors in Physics and Chemistry) from North Bengal University - Siliguri College[cite: 1].
